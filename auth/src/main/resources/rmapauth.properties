#The Auth ID prefix is used to construct an RMap Auth ID for an Agent that is unique within the RMap instance 
#Auth IDs are generated by performing SHA256 encoding of the ID provider and the account ID (e.g. email address)
#this prefix will appear before the encoded string, and will convert the string to a URI.  The prefix can be a URL 
#or a string of text that will convert the SHA256 string to a URI.
rmapauth.authIdPrefix=rmap:/authid/
# The base URL is used to construct paths that require the RMap website as a prefix.
# Should not include a trailing forward-slash
